Here's you will get all **LeetCode** Problems Solved By me.
***

- Two Sum<br/>
[Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
 *an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target*
<br/> Solution [here](https://github.com/Angryl/Leetcode/blob/main/Two%20Sum.cpp)
 
 - Reverse Integer<br/>
 [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/)
 *Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.*
<br/>Solution [here](https://github.com/Angryl/Leetcode/blob/main/reverse-Integer.java)

- Palindrome Number<br/>
[problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/)
An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward. For example, 121 is palindrome while 123 is not.
<br/>Solution [here](https://github.com/Angryl/Leetcode/blob/main/Plaindrome%20number.java)

- Longest common Prefix<br/>
[problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-prefix/)
Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.
<br/>Solution [here](https://github.com/Angryl/Leetcode/blob/main/Longest%20Common%20Prefix.java)

- Valid Parentheses<br/>
[problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/)
Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.<br/>
solution [here](https://github.com/Angryl/Leetcode/blob/main/Valid%20Parentheses.java)

-  Merge Two Sorted Lists<br/>
[problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)
Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.<br/>
solution [here](https://github.com/Angryl/Leetcode/blob/main/Merge%20Two%20Sorted%20Lists.java)

- Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array<br/>
[problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/)
Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.<br/>
solution [here](https://github.com/Angryl/Leetcode/blob/main/Remove%20Duplicates%20from%20Sorted%20Array.java)

- Remove Element<br/>
[problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/)
Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The relative order of the elements may be changed.<br/>
solution [here](https://github.com/Angryl/Leetcode/blob/main/Remove%20Element.py)

- Search Insert Position<br/>
[problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/ )
Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.<br/>
solution [here](https://github.com/Angryl/Leetcode/blob/main/Search%20Insert%20Position.java)
